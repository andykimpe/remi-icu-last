This package is a backport of RHEL-7 version for older versions.

libicu-last is designed to be installed beside system libicu.

icu-last and libicu-last-devel cannot be installed with icu or
libicu-devel, but are usually not needed.

So this version will stay at 50.1.2 as long as this allow
to satisfy PHP dependencies.
